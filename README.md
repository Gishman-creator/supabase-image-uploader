# Supabase Image Uploader

This is a Next.js project that allows users to upload images to Supabase storage. The application prompts the user to enter a bucket name and an image URL, and it displays a preview of the image before uploading.

## Getting Started

First, create a `.env.local` file and add your Supabase URL and Service Role Key:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-supabase-service-role-key
```

Next, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```


Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```


Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Available Scripts

- `dev`: Runs the app in development mode.
- `build`: Builds the app for production.
- `start`: Starts the production server.
- `lint`: Lints the code.
